# Password-Generator

## Description
This project involves finishing a JavaScript starter code for a random number/password generator. To do this, I had to create variables and arrays, all of which connect to the random number selector function. The function arbitrarily picks a desired amount(between 8 and 128) of letters, numbers, special characters extracted from the array; this was made possible by forloops. Additionally, I also made use of Booleans to end the forloop.
